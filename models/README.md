# Face-API.js Models

This directory should contain the model files for face-api.js. Download them from the official face-api.js repository:

1. Go to: https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights
2. Download all `.json` files into this folder

Required models:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
- And their corresponding weight files

Without these model files, the face detection will not work.
